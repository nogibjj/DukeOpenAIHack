"In the opening moments of the game, it's all about the tip-off, and Daniel Theis of the Boston Celtics jumps against Gasol. The tip goes to VanVleet of the Raptors, who sets the pace early on. Pascal Siakam attempts a 13-foot driving floating jump shot, but he can't find the mark, and the score remains unchanged. However, Theis is quick to grab the rebound, showing his presence on the boards. He's not just about defense; he takes a 4-foot driving floating jump shot himself but misses this time. Nevertheless, he's tenacious, snatching his own rebound. The Raptors, not to be outdone, respond as Siakam capitalizes on a second chance and puts in a 2-foot driving layup. The game is heating up. Shortly after, Jaylen Brown of the Celtics matches it with a driving layup of his own, courtesy of Theis's assist, tying the score at 2-2. But Kyle Lowry has other plans, sinking a deep 26-foot three-pointer, giving the Raptors a 5-2 lead. The Celtics aren't backing down, and Gordon Hayward drills a 25-foot three-pointer, assisted by Brown, leveling the score at 5-5. The action is fast-paced in the early minutes of this matchup, and both teams are showing their offensive prowess."
